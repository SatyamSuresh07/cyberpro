Internship Projects – Naviotech Solution (2026)
Author: Satyam Suresh

📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of academic and practical cybersecurity projects completed as part of a Cybersecurity Internship at Naviotech Solution.
The projects focus on human-centric security risks, enterprise security architecture, and risk assessment frameworks, aligned with industry standards such as NIST, OWASP, and Zero Trust principles.

The repository includes:

1 Major Project

2 Minor Projects

Detailed project reports (PDF)

PowerPoint presentations (PPT) for academic and internship evaluation

Documentation suitable for university submission and examiner review
🧠 Major Project
Phishing Awareness Simulation Using Social Engineering Techniques

Objective:
To ethically simulate phishing attacks in a controlled environment to understand attacker techniques and improve user awareness.

Key Highlights:

Focus on email-based phishing attacks

Study of human behavior and psychological manipulation

No real credentials collected (ethical compliance)

Analysis of user responses to phishing indicators

Techniques Studied:

Email phishing

Website spoofing

Urgency-based messaging

Brand impersonation

Tools & Technologies:

HTML & CSS

Google Forms

Gmail

Kali Linux (SET – theoretical)

Key Learning:

Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity; awareness training is as critical as technical controls.

🧪 Minor Project – 1
Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

Objective:
To design a practical and scalable cybersecurity risk assessment framework for SMEs using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

Core Components:

Risk Identification

Risk Evaluation (Likelihood × Impact model)

Risk Classification (Low / Medium / High)

Case-based validation

Threats Covered:

Phishing attacks

Ransomware

Insider threats

Weak authentication

Unpatched systems

Framework Base:

NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)

Outcome:
Provides SMEs with a cost-effective and easy-to-implement cybersecurity risk management model.

🏗️ Minor Project – 2
Zero Trust Architecture for Enterprise Security

Objective:
To design and simulate a Zero Trust security model for modern enterprise environments.

Core Principle:

Never Trust, Always Verify

Security Models Implemented:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Key Concepts:

Least privilege access

Continuous authentication

Micro-segmentation

Encrypted communication

Simulation Environment:

VMware / VirtualBox

Docker

Multi-VM enterprise setup including attacker simulation

Result:
Zero Trust architecture significantly reduced unauthorized access and lateral movement compared to traditional perimeter security.
